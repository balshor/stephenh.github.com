Does Java have to Die? See C#
=============================

In the ever-popular what-will-supersede-Java discussions, a very common assertion is that Java itself is simply not capable of being fixed. The syntax it is just too bad, too old, and a clean slate is the only way to go.

I want to challenge this assertion by offering a simple counter-example: C#.

While I have not personally programmed in C# in years, I have kept up on the language development and it is actually quite impressive what they've been doing. From my outsider standpoint, they have successfully updated the language, kept it current, fresh, and awesome.

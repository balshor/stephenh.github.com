title: Calling Bullshit on Convention Over Configuration
---

Many Java frameworks these days boast of "Convention over Configuration", usually in the same breathe as "we're like Rails!"

Except then you read their examples, and they use annotations.

Huh? You don't read Rails code and see all of this "@Component" crap littering the codebase.

Annotations **are** configuration.

They are just configuration in your Java code instead of XML. Which, yes, is a step up (sometimes), but can we please stop pretending that it is this magical, Rail's-hyped "convention" buzzword?

I like Java, but thanks to crap like not being able to traverse packages, I assert it's pretty hard to do anything that is truly "convention".

Perhaps I'm sheltered though--if anyone asserts they've seen good/pure "convention" approaches in Java, I'd appreciate a link.

title: Going Live on eMachines
---

I was looking at Wicket again tonight, and came across:

    For many applications, it will be worth trading off the increased server load of extra server-side state for decreased development costs, lower maintenance costs, quicker time-to-market and generally higher quality software.

    The basic observation here is that software is expensive and complex while servers from companies like E-machines and Dell are relatively dirt cheap.

Cool--I agree on the development vs. hardware cost trade off.

But who deploys webapps on $298 eMachines desktops?

Pick a real server company and his point still applies, so no problem there--I'm just being an ass.

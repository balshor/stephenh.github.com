Indignation
===========

Over Instagram worth $1 billion.

* Not a profitable business sold for a multiple of yearly income
  * Without Facebook, it's not worth anything
  * Constrast with Mint, which actually made money because it had an innovative business model--kudos. No one was pissed at Mint.
* Founder/VCs didn't even go into a mobile business (was originally something else), instead ending up picking a "lottery ticket" founder--how can you attribute that to skill?
* How can a traditional business compete with "social"? Even traditional software business? Whoever can build the most free thing for the most users wins. So yet more people dick around online and not have real friends.
  * I suppose users pay for games, and the game companies pay Facebook. Not sure how Instagram works in to that.

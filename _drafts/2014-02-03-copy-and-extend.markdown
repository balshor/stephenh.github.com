title: Copy & Extend, The Best Way To Learn

{{page.title}}
==============

After years of internal and external lamentation about the ugliness of my blog, I yet again hit the tipping point and started playing around with the layout.

I'm not going to win any design awards, but I was pleasantly surprised this time around, and it was solely from my drastically different approach.

What Didn't Work: Starting from Scratch
---------------------------------------

Previously, I would sit down and try to divine some magic layout and color schemes.

I would pretend I was a real designer, and hop over to one the color picking tools (based on the color wheel, contrasting colors, whatever), slosh around some HTML, and see what came out.

The result was always terribly disappointing.

I could also tell it was disappointing.

I think often times, naivety is a blessing when you're learning, but you don't realize how bad your results are, so instead of becoming discouraged, you keep plugging along, until the repetition was made you better.

But, in this case, I'm a user of beautiful (and not beautiful) webapps on a daily basis, so I'm aware of the difference. It was very apparent for my work.

What Did Work: Copy & Extend
----------------------------

Without really realizing it ahead of time, this time I took a different approach.

Over the last few months, I had bookmarked a few websites that I liked:

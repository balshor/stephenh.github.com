  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>This is the blog of Stephen Haberman.</p>

  <p>After years of not having much to contribute, my ego has finally convinced me otherwise. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>I'm a co-founder of <a href="http://www.exigencecorp.com">Exigence</a>,
  though lately I've been enjoying working for <a href="http://www.bizo.com">Bizo</a>.</p>

  <p>I enjoy software development a little too much. It makes me good at what I
  do, but it also brings out some of my draconian overlord tendencies.</p>

  <p>I'm on <a href="http://github.com/stephenh">github</a> and <a
    href="http://linkedin.com/in/stephenhaberman">LinkedIn</a>. I also started
  the <a href="http://joist.ws">Joist</a> open source project, but it's waiting
  for some real-world projects to drive its development.</p>

  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>This is the blog of Stephen Haberman.</p>

  <p>After years of thinking I did not have much to contribute, my ego has finally convinced me otherwise. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen.</p>

  <p>I was a co-founder of <a href="http://www.exigencecorp.com">Exigence</a>,
  though lately I've been enjoying working for <a href="http://www.bizo.com">Bizo</a>.</p>

  <p>I enjoy software development a little too much. It makes me good at what I
  do, but it also brings out some of my draconian tendencies.</p>

  <p>
    I'm on <a href="http://github.com/stephenh">github</a>
    and <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/stephenhaberman">LinkedIn</a>.
    I have a handful of open source projects, but <a href="http://joist.ws">Joist</a>
    and <a href="http://www.tessell.org">Tessell</a> are the primary ones.
